Statistical mechanics - or at least equilibrium statistical mechanics is 'just' about the calculation of the partition function

$$
Z = \sum_j \exp(-\beta \epsilon_j).
$$

The point, of course, is that for any but the simplest systems (e.g. free particles) evaluating $Z$ is computationally intractable. Approximating the partition function and its derivatives, as well as the marginal distribution and correlation functions of subsets of observables, is the real work of statistical physics.

The same goes for machine learning.
