# Abstract

We consider the one-dimensional expansion of a system of interacting bosons, starting from a regular array. Without interactions the familiar Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect for bosons gives rise to a series of peaks in the density-density correlations of the expanded system. Infinitely repulsive particles likewise give a series of dips, a signature of the underlying description in terms of free fermions. In the intermediate case of finite interaction, the noise correlations consist of a set of Fano resonance lineshapes, with an asymmetry parameter determined by the scattering phase shift of a pair of particles and a width depending on the initial momentum spread of the particles.
