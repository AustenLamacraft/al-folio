# Abstract

We use a method based on the semiclassical analysis of \\(\sigma\\)-models to describe the phenomenon of strong localization in quasi one-dimensional conductors, obtaining the density of transmission eigenvalues. For several symmetry classes, describing random superconducting and chiral Hamiltonians, the target space of the appropriate \\(\sigma\\)-model is a (super)group manifold. In these cases our approach turns out to be exact. The results offer a perspective on localization.
