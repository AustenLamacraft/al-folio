# Abstract

Mechanisms of quantum phase coherence heavily influence spectral and transport properties of weakly disordered normal conductors. Such effects are manifest in weak and strong localization effects, and characteristic fluctuation phenomena. Over the past thirty years, theoretical progress in elucidating the mechanisms of quantum phase coherence in weakly disordered structures has been substantial: By now a consistent theory of weakly interacting disordered structures has been developed (For a review, see e.g., Refs. [1-3]).
