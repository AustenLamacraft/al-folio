The __Fredricksonâ€“Andersen__ model is an example of a __kinetically constrained model__, and was introduced as a model of cooperative relaxation near the glass transition. Recently, [we showed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/2018-06-06-noisy-qubits.md %}) that it also arises in a quite different context, describing the spreading of the support of a local operator in a stochastic spin system.
