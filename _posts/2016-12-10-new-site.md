My web pages are in serious need of an overhaul. In the past I've built my sites using [RapidWeaver](https://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/), but it was never particularly future proof: something always needed updating.

Now I'm switching to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which I used for the first time over the summer. Relative to a WYSIWYG editor it's a bit more work, but you feel like you know what's going on under the bonnet. There's a large ecosystem, lots of [themes](http://themes.jekyllrc.org), free hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The ease of writing in Markdown and rendering mathematics with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) is wonderful.

See?

It would be great to integrate this with [Symplectic](https://symplectic.admin.cam.ac.uk) and / or [ORCID](http://orcid.org) to get an automatically updated publication list. Let's see.
