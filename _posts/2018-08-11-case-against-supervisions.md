Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge consists of lectures and _supervisions_, a slightly confusing term for small group tutorials (as they are more sensibly known at Oxford), and one of the things these two universities like to trumpet as USPs. The idea that sitting down once a week with a dedicated _supervisor_ to discuss your work -- perhaps with another student, perhaps by yourself -- is viscerally appealing. The idealised image is of the student(s) being challenged by a world-leading expert in their field to defend their ideas, pushing them on to their intellectual limit. You get the idea.

Belief in the superiority of the supervision system is more or less an article of faith at Cambridge, and up until very recently we (and Oxford) got [special funding](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/oxbridge-to-be-stripped-of-special-funding-feeding-the-tutorial-system) from the government to support it. Does it work? This is a difficult question to answer across all subjects, as the supervision experience will undoubtedly vary greatly. In the technical disciplines, where [quantitative research](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410) into the effectiveness of different pedagogical approaches is possible, it might be possible to say something, though I'm unaware of any research specifically into the efficacy of small group teaching.

[The history of the supervision system is interesting in its own right. Supervisions grew out of a system of private 'coaching' -- the origin of the word -- that existed in the 19th century due to the paucity of university lecturing in mathematics. See Andrew Warwick's [Masters of Theory](https://books.google.com/books/about/Masters_of_Theory.html?id=YRlQA-Fur_sC). While the emphasis was always on problem solving over abstract formalism -- which I assume everyone agrees with these days -- the balance of watching versus doing in these early supervisions isn't clear.]

Here, I just want to highlight some factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that bear on the (in)effectiveness of the supervision system. I'm not saying it's not the best system (though in the absence of proof why would we believe it is?), but we certainly can't say it's without flaws.

0. Some fraction (very roughly around 50% in the sciences and mathematics) of the supervisions a student receives are based in the student's college. This is in contrast to the lectures, where the course material is formally taught, that are arranged by the departments. That means

1. Labour-intensive

2. Conservative

3. Runs counter to current trends in peer instruction
